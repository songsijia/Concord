version 1.0.4

After months of beta and manual version control, Concord is now on Github!

Newest changes:
* added an echo to tell you if you've been removed from the room, and which way to go to get back in
* fixed a bug where you would call an empty enter/exit warning if someone entered and left in the same action
* Aquamancer melds will no longer gag your entire screen output
* Added support for automatic locating of players via seeing stone
